# Garbage Segregation Classification Model

![Garbage Segregation](https://www.imgbly.com/ib/vHZgUDWafA.png)

Welcome to the Garbage Segregation Classification Model repository! This repository contains the machine learning model and associated resources developed by our garbage collection startup for classifying different types of garbage, including paper, food waste, wood, and leaves. The model is designed to facilitate the segregation of unsegregated waste for efficient recycling and disposal.

## Model Architecture

We have utilized the SqueezeNet architecture for our garbage segregation classification model. SqueezeNet is a lightweight deep neural network that achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing the model size. This choice allows us to deploy the model efficiently across different platforms and devices.

## Hugging Face Integration

To streamline the deployment and management of our model, we have utilized the Hugging Face framework. Hugging Face provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for training, fine-tuning, and deploying machine learning models. Our model is available through the Hugging Face model hub, allowing easy access for integration with other systems and applications.

## Repository Structure

- `app.py`: This file contains the code for the garbage segregation classification model, including the SqueezeNet architecture, training, and evaluation functions.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required to run the model code.

## Model Deployment

We are currently in the process of integrating our garbage segregation classification model with our garbage collection machines. Once deployed, these machines will leverage the model's capabilities to automatically separate unsegregated waste, thereby improving the efficiency of our garbage collection operations.

## Usage
